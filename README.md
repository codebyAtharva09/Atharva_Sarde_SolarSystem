# 3D Solar System Simulation – Atharva Sarde

## Overview
This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It visualizes the Sun and all major planets (including the Moon), complete with textures, orbital motion, and user controls for exploration and learning.

## Features
- Realistic 3D models of the Sun, planets  with accurate textures.
- Animated orbits for each planet and the Moon.
- Adjustable orbital speeds for each celestial body via a control panel.
- Interactive camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate) using mouse.
- Click on any planet to smoothly zoom in and view its details.
- Tooltip displays planet names on hover.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Saturn’s rings and a starfield background for added realism.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Explore the solar system using your mouse and the on-screen controls.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – Main interactive solar system simulation.
- `index1.html` – Enhanced version with planet descriptions and info box.
- `assets/textures/` – Image textures for planets, the Sun, Saturn’s rings, and the starfield.
- `.vscode/settings.json` – Recommended VS Code settings.

## Credits
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.
- Planet textures from various open sources (NASA, Solar System Scope, etc.).
- UI inspired by modern web design practices.
